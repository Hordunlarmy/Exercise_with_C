## Saying Hello
# Constraint

variables.

greetings for different people.

## Counting the Number of Characters
# Constraints
- [x] Be sure the output contains the original string.
- [x] Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- [x] Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.

# Challenges
- [x] If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
