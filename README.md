# Saying Hello
**Constraint**
- [x] Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

**Challenges**
- [ ] Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
- [ ] Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people.

# Counting the Number of Characters
**Constraints**
- [x] Be sure the output contains the original string.
- [x] Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- [x] Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.

**Challenges**
- [x] If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
- [ ] Implement this program using a graphical userinterface
and update the character counter every time a key is
pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly
friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.

# Printing Quotes
**Constraints**
- [x] Use a single output statement to produce this output,
using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
- [x] If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, don’t use it for this exercise. Use string
concatenation instead

**Challenge**
- [ ] Modify this program so that
instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that holds quotes and their associated
attributions and then display all of the quotes
